Networking setup for mjmech

================
High level goals
================

 (1) A reliable video and control channel which works even when 2.4GHz band is
     very busy.

 (2) A way to upload/debug new code. Does not have to be as reliable.

===================
Implementable goals
===================

 - Use dual-band 802.11n cards. 'n' should give us stream diversity, while 5GHz
   band will be likely less congested.

 - Do not use WiFi association mechanisms, to make sure that short periods of
   total interference stay short.

 - Customize queue length and retransmission, to make sure that at least some
   video appears, and that the latency is not too high.

 - Be able to change the system properties reasonably fast (in under a
   minute, not during the match).

==============
Current Design
==============

We are using ad-hoc mode, but specifying all the parameters ourselves.
This should be enough to ensure that we can start communicating without having
to wait for other station, and that we will not re-negotiate mid links.

We are logging all the packets and measuring the latencies.

To set up, use the script 'setup_wifi_link.py'. All wifi details are there.

IP addressing:
 - Devices have IP in the 10.89.0.0/16 network
  - Well-known devices have short addresses:
     mjmech-odroid has 10.89.0.10
 - Multicast network is 239.89.108.0/24
   239.89.108.10:2720 is multicast announcements from odroid
   239.89.108.11:2721 is control commands

Wifi card comments
=================

We want a wifi card that supports 5GHz and 802.11n, at least. These have
problems.

Testing wireless cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a new wireless card, you can check it as following:

- Basic setup
(1) on main PC, set up wifi link and a monitor mode. run 'horst' on it.
 - In horst, enter 'ESSID' screen ('e' key), you should see the
   telemetry network.
 - bring wifi interface down on the main PC. the TSF value on horst will freeze.
 - bring wifi interface up on DUT.
 - Make sure TSF updates often and 'source' matches DUT's wireless MAC.
 - Make sure parameters (CH=channel, BSSID, BINT=beacon interval)
   match the configured ones.

(2) Start sending packets into 'empty space' (since PC has not joined yet)
 - In a new window:
tools/odroid/push-tree.sh odroid-mjmech \
  scons base/build-armv7l/udp_manual_test '&&' \
   base/build-armv7l/udp_manual_test -v \
      --socket1.send_addr 239.89.108.10:12720 --socket1.send_interval_s=0.005 \
      --socket2.listen_addr 239.89.108.11:12721 --socket2.do_recv=1

 - Make sure packets are being sent. We do not expect to recevie anything at
   this time.
 INFO[socket1]: stats: tx_count=1968 tx_size=1968000
 INFO[socket2]: stats: (no data)

 - In horst, switch to 'Stats' ('a' key)
  - You may want to 'R'eset the stats
  - Make sure prevalent rate is as configured in python (24M)
  - Make sure 'Retries' is very low and not growing.
  - Make sure 'Total bits/sec' is correct: 1.5M = 1000 bytes * 200 Hz
  - Make sure 'Total usage' is reasonable (for configuration descirbed above,
    it is 9-10%)

(3) on main PC, bring the wireless interface back up.
 - Make sure you can ping 10.89.0.10
 - On horst ESSID screen, make sure channel/BSSID did not change.

(4) Start sending
 - Window 1:
scons -j4 base/build-x86_64/udp_manual_test && \
   base/build-x86_64/udp_manual_test -v \
      --socket1.send_addr 239.89.108.11:12721 --socket1.send_interval_s=0.005 \
      --socket2.listen_addr 239.89.108.10:12720 --socket2.do_recv=1

 - Both windows will print statistics every 10 seconds. Make sure the loss is
   less <90%:
 INFO[socket1]: stats: tx_count=1967 tx_size=1967000
 INFO[socket2]: stats: rx[10.89.0.10:46963]=1936 rx_count=1936 rx_size=1936000

 - In horst, switch to 'Stats'.
  - Make sure rate and retries are still correct.
  - The 'Total bit/sec' will double.
  - The 'Total usage' willb bigger -- for configuration descirbed above, it is 24-25%

(5) Bring down the wireless interface on the main PC again.
 - Make sure the packets are still being sent as in item (2)

Security
~~~~~~~~

We have to think about security -- in the large event, there may be all sorts
of people.

For reliability, we cannot use stateful security like WPA/WPA2. We may use WEP
eventually, but it will be disabled initially to simplify troubleshooting.

Attack: taking over robot
Status: not relevant -- we already use SSH to upload; assuming that our
application is not stupidly insecure, it will not provide any access to the
robot' OS.

Attack: taking over controlling laptop
Status: uses either our app or existing servers; our app should be fine, as long
at it is not stupidly unsecure; as for other apps, it is not worse than using
laptop in the coffee shop.

Attack: Denial of service.
Status: very likely possible, esp. if we crash on invalid packets. But wifi is
easily jammable anyway anyway. TODO theamk finish

Attack: information disclosure
Status: whatever. We have no confidential info over the channel (unless a
competitor incorporates it in their UI :) )

Robot link setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our only option is usb<->wifi cards -- the robot has no other fast exposed
buses, and integrated wifi is not present / not dual-band.

Base station setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to be able to fully control base stations (obviously venue's AP will
not work, or may not be present at all). The options are:

- Dedicate a router for base station, hook it to laptop via ethernet.
 - PRO: may have very little latency if we write on-router daemon and card is
        connected via PCI.
 - PRO: nothing interferes with wifi setup
 - PRO: may be placed very close to the stage
 - CON: need to setup packet forwarding or write on-router daemon
 - CON: the dual-band N models may be large, require external power

- Use external USB card
 - PRO: small size, no external power supply needed.
 - PRO: May use the same type of the card the mech uses.
 - CON: USB adds some latency.
 - CON: NetworkManager will interfere.
  - Disable it completely (annoying as built-in wifi may be used during
    development / debugging).
  - May use network namespaces
   - This requires that anything that wants to talk to it has a root access.
   - Or we need to setup a 'virtual router' that needs the same
     packet-forwaring setup or router daemon that physical router requires.
  - May just add card's MAC to networkmanager ignore file
   - This is tricky to get right. Should probably script this.

- Use laptop's integrated network card
 - PRO: lower latency than USB-based cards
 - CON: intervet will not work if integrated card was used for it.
 - PRO: can just disable networkmanager's wifi entirely.
 - CON: not sure how good integrated antenna is.
 - CON: laptop's card may not be good enough, and we won't be able to use it.
